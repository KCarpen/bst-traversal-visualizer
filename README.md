## BST-traversal-visualizer

# Codesmith solo project --

In this solo project, I hope to create a graphical interface where the user can visualize BST traversal algorithms. The user will be able to input their own BST or generate a random BST, use a built in traversal algorithm, and visualize the traversal process.
